While on the island I worked as a diver and worked towards obtaining my private pilot's liscence while playing several sports. After high school I attended the University of Washington to learn Biology.</p><p>While I loved the science world it wasn't the career I wanted to pursue so I quit my job and went to a accelerated programming course in 2015. I feel in love with programing and got a job at Extreme Arts & Sciences, a small digital agency in Seattle, WA. I learned everything I know there and worked my way up from being a know nothing junior developer to head of development and a part owner. We will see what happens next!</p><p>-Jens</p>"
